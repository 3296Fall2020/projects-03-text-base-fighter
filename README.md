# Text Base Fighter
Created by GitHub Classroom, Section 03

## Project Overview
This project is a text-based RPG game written in Java. The game, as it stands when it was made open-source, is a very basic game in which the player fights monster, levels up and purchases new items. As a team, we are developing an extension to the game to add more depth and make the game nicer. 

## Vision Statement
---
The game is for people who loved 1970s games. The game should provide an authentic nostalgic feeling that harkens back to that era. By the time that this project is complete, Text Base Fighter should become a fleshed out and interesting RPG that showcases the reliability of basic Java tools. It will be a complete, fun experience that any player can open and enjoy.

Aley's Persona: <br/>
Danny, Student <br/>

Danny is 17 years old and grew up in the city of Philadelphia. He goes to an engineering high school in North Phildelphia. He grew up with both of his parents along with an older brother and sister. Every Wednesday after school he would attend Robotics to help his team code on the robot's behavior. Danny likes playing videogames in his free time. <br/>

Danny's programming background is more than the average person, but only enough to what a normal high school can teach. With his hobby for video games and his background for programming, text-based fighter is the perfect game for him to play because it allows him to appreciate the mechanics of the game as well as enjoy it for what it is. <br/>

Bob, the electrical engineer. <br/>

Bob used to be a huge fan of game in 70s, he build himself a computer when he was a high-school student. Because the computer at that time is hardly run any 2d graphic game. So, the very first game he try is the Zork.  <br/>

Now, he is 60 years-old and want to something that can let him recall time when he was young, but able to run on modern platform. <br/>

Still trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life besides playing retro-style games in his downtime.

Chuck, Father/Family Man <br/>

Chuck is a 37-year-old contruction worker who has a 5-year-old son and another on the way. His son enjoys games and chuck enjoys spending time with his boy. Since his son is not that old he doesn't want him to see anything too graphic yet it games and but also wants his son to understand what he's playing. <br/>

A textbase fighter is perfect for some family friendly bonding between a boy and his dad. <br/>

Darnell's Persona: <br/>
Carl, Computer Science Student

Carl is a college student who's majoring in computer science. Carl wants to learn more about Java and how different classes can come together to create a complete application. He picks Text Base Fighter as a project to study, because it has a clear and simple organizational structure. Carl finds value in Text Base Fighter as a tool to learn more about programming, rather than just being a game.



## Main Contributions and Project Features
There are four main things that we, as a team, are planning to create in this project

1. Create a Tutorial - The tutorial is a scripted encounter with a basic monster that will be used to teach the plyer the basic way the game should be played.
2. Create a Story/Adventure Mode - Currently, the game is in free play, with no ending. The Story Mode would be a series of increaingly difficult encounters in which the player would eventually finish the game. It will be an option in addition to the free play mode.
3. Add Character Images/GUI - As of this time, Text Base Fighter has only one image: it's splash screen. We intend to include a set of images to represent monsters, items and other game elements to make the UI feel more alive.
4. Create Classes - Add starting classes that effect the plyers strating HP, armor, and weapon. Maybe add weapon compatiblity, like only mages can use staffs and only archers can use bows.  

We can also add more encounters and items, but these are the main points of the project.
