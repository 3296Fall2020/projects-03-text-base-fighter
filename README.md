Aley's Persona: <br/>
Danny, Student <br/>

Danny is 17 years old and grew up in the city of Philadelphia. He goes to an engineering high school in North Phildelphia. He grew up with both of his parents along with an older brother and sister. Every Wednesday after school he would attend Robotics to help his team code on the robot's behavior. Danny likes playing videogames in his free time. <br/>

Danny's programming background is more than the average person, but only enough to what a normal high school can teach. With his hobby for video games and his background for programming, text-based fighter is the perfect game for him to play because it allows him to appreciate the mechanics of the game as well as enjoy it for what it is. <br/>

Bob, the electrical engineer. <br/>

Bob used to be a huge fan of game in 70s, he build himself a computer when he was a high-school student. Because the computer at that time is hardly run any 2d graphic game. So, the very first game he try is the Zork.  <br/>

Now, he is 60 years-old and want to something that can let him recall time when he was young, but able to run on modern platform. <br/>
